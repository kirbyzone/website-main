        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2 text-cream">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
          This cookie policy (“Policy”) describes what cookies are and how they're used by the <strong>kirby.zone</strong> website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”).
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and Kirbyzone Pty Ltd (doing business as “Kirbyzone”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Website and Services.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          You should read this Policy so you can understand the types of cookies we use, the information we collect using cookies and how that information is used. It also describes the choices available to you regarding accepting or declining the use of cookies.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2 text-cream">What are cookies?</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Cookies are small pieces of data stored in text files that are saved on your computer, mobile or other devices when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to remember you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a "session cookie") or for multiple repeat visits (using a "persistent cookie").
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used during the course of your visit to the Website, and they expire when you close the web browser.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Persistent cookies are used to remember your preferences within our Website and remain on your computer or mobile device even after you close your browser or restart your computer. They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for you while visiting the Website and Services.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Cookies may be set by the Website ("first-party cookies"), or by third parties, such as the payment processing services on the Website ("third party cookies"). These third parties can then 'remember' you when you visit our website again, and can also recognise you when you visit certain other websites related to our services.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2 text-cream">What type of cookies do we use?</h2>

        </p>

        <h3 class="font-bold">• Analytical cookies</h3>

        <p class="mb-2">

          An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Website and Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes.
        </p>
